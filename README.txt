DISCORD SINGS BOT.PY

Ever wanted to do Discord sings events but you are kind of lonely or want a bot to join in? Well this source code is PERFECT for you.

This source code will watch for a list of words or phrases and response with Lyrics that you set in it in the channels
that are enabled to sing in.

================================================

Instructions for Setup
1. Download/Fork this Source code
2. Create a Bot Application in the Developer Portal and create a bot and copy the bot token
3. At the bottom with client.run("INSERTBOTTOKENHERE"), replace INSERTBOTTOKENHERE with your bot token.
4. On the On Message
>>> responses = [], Add quotations and put in a lyric sample of what a response you want the bot to respond too. (See the example in main.py)
5. Open singtrigger.txt and make a list of words or phrases you want the bot to watch for and respond with Lyrics you inputted
6. Save Everything and run the bot.

Optional Steps:
At client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = '!'), replace ! with the prefix you want.

=================================================

HOW TO USE/HOW DOES IT WORK.

To have a bot sing in a text channel you want, simply do <prefix>singtrue in the channel you want and the bot will store your channel id
and know to sing in that channel if a set word or phrase(s) are being said in that channel.

To disable the bot from singing in the enabled text channel, use <prefix>singfalse
